Your brother, Paul, who looks alot like you, runs up to you from across the pier.

"Paul! I thought you were in Hong Kong.", you exclaim, wondering why he's back in New York so early.

"Welcome to the Coalition, JC... I might as well start using your codename. Think I'd miss my brother's first day?" he replies jokingly.

"Didn't think you'd have a choice. What's going on?" you question, Paul shouldn't have been back for awhile yet, and he's not the type to disobey orders.

"The NSF -- they hit one of our shipments. A few of them got away, but we trapped the rest in the Statue." Paul gestured up to the Statue of Liberty looming behind him, standing tall in the middle of the island. You can see it has taken some damage, the head is missing, and there is other notable damage and burns to the structure.

"What are we waiting for? Looks like a textbook assault." you respond eagerly, ready to charge on forward.
You begin walking ahead but Paul puts his hand out and stops you in your tracks.

"The NSF took one of our agents hostage. The bots are holding the perimeter, but my orders are to hold back and send you in alone. I think someone high up wants to see how you handle the situation." he states.

"All I've got with me is a pistol and an electric prod. I don't mind a test, but UNATCO better issue some hardware." you reply, realising you weren't prepared for such an involved mission.

"Remember that we're police. Stick with the prod. It will stun your opponents or knock them unconscious. A nonlethal takedown is always the most silent way to eliminate resistance." Paul opens up a storage box that was sitting beside him, you can see a few weapons inside. "Just in case, though, Manderley wants you to pick an additional weapon: a sniper rifle, a GEP gun, or a minicrossbow."

You reply...

"I like to pick 'em off from a distance. I'll take the rifle." you say, as you reach in to the crate and pull out a PIS LRW350 Military Sniper Rifle, and a few clips of 30.06 ammo.

Paul places his hand on the barrel of the rifle. "This isn't a training exercise, JC. Your targets will be human beings. Keep that in mind."

You've heard Paul's lectures about restraint many times before. "I get up the idea. What's the first move?" 

<<elseif $paul_choice == "GEP Gun">>
"Never know when I might come up against heavy armor. Give me the GEP gun." You reach over and grab the Guided Explosive Projectile (GEP) Gun, a portable shoulder-mounted rocket launcher.

Paul hands you a couple of spare rockets. "The GEP gun might be useful. They have a security bot on patrol near the Statue entrance."

You finish loading the launcher, and stow the weapon away in your inventory. "Great. What's the first move?"

<<elseif $paul_choice == "Mini-Crossbow">>
"The crossbow. Sometimes you've got to make a silent takedown." Paul hands you the Mini-Crossbow, a small wrist-mounted espionage weapon, codenamed Night Sleeper, designed for fire various types of darts, including standard shots, flare darts, and the most useful tranq darts.

Paul nods approvingly, and hands you some spare darts for ammunition. "Good thinking. With these tranquilizer darts, you'll have another nonlethal way to take down an enemy in addition to the prod." 

"I get the idea. What's the first move?" You are eager to get going.
<<if>>

Paul hands you a small datacube. "I'm going to give you a map of the island. If you can get to the north dock, a UNATCO informant will give you a key to the Statue doors. He responds to the code-phrase 'iron and copper.' You could avoid a lot of fighting, though, if you found a back way into the Statue."

"I'll see how it looks onshore..." You reply as you finish scanning the information device, storing the map and a reference to the codeword in your datavault. 

PAUL DENTON
Your primary objective is the makeshift command center the terrorists installed
at the top of the Statue, but don't forget about Agent Hermann. We think he's
being held on the ground floor.

JC DENTON
What are my orders when I reach the command center?

PAUL DENTON
Interrogate the leader. We don't yet know why the terrorists would risk an open
assault.

JC DENTON
You just going to stay here?

PAUL DENTON
There's been some activity at sea. I'm going to watch the coast.

JC DENTON
Why'd they bring you back to New York?

PAUL DENTON
I don't know what they have planned. I messed up an assassination attempt on one
of the Triad leaders in Hong Kong.

JC DENTON
UNATCO pulled you out?

PAUL DENTON
It's a long story. You better head to the Statue.

JC DENTON
Which Triad was UNATCO targeting?

PAUL DENTON
We'll talk about that later. How was your graduation?

JC DENTON
I want to hear what happened.

PAUL DENTON
I wish I could have come. At the time I could have cared less that Mom and Dad
came to mine, but it was a good thing. The U.N. threw a dinner in honor of me,
the first nano-augmented agent.

JC DENTON
I didn't know that. Guess I must be old news.

PAUL DENTON
Dad made a toast. I don't know if you remember his old brown suit...

JC DENTON
A toast? That doesn't sound like our father.

PAUL DENTON
It was hard for him in front of the diplomats, but he savored every moment.

JC DENTON
Strange how proud he could be when so much was due to... our augmentations.

PAUL DENTON
Yes, he was proud. I believe that much. It was nice to have done something for
him and Mom. I wish someone could have been there for you.

JC DENTON
I'm used to being on my own.

PAUL DENTON
One can be TOO self-sufficient, I'm coming to believe.
Best thing is to let the bots handle the ground assault.
You might be able to find some supplies in the comm van by the helipad.
Hard to believe this rock used to be a tourist attraction, huh?
I'll keep watch on this side of the island.
